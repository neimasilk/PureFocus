## 1. Getting Started

After installing PureFocus, you will be immediately greeted with a clean main interface. There is no complicated setup process; you can start writing right away.

## 2. Key Features

### Focus Write Mode

*   **Minimalist Interface:** Only the text area and essential timer control buttons. No distracting menus, toolbars, or notifications from other applications (during an active focus session).
*   **Distraction-Free:** Designed to help you concentrate fully on your writing.

### Integrated Pomodoro Timer

*   **Structured Focus Sessions:** Divide your work into focus intervals (e.g., 25 minutes) followed by short breaks (e.g., 5 minutes).
*   **End-of-Session Notifications:** The application will notify you when a focus or break session ends.
*   **State Persistence:** If the app is closed or restarted during an active timer session, it will automatically resume from where it left off when reopened.

### Session Settings

*   **Flexible Durations:** You can adjust the duration of focus sessions and break sessions according to your preferences and needs via the Settings screen.

### Auto-save

*   **Don't Worry About Losing Work:** Your text is automatically saved periodically as you type. When a focus session ends, the latest text will be saved.

## 3. Basic Usage

### Starting a Focus Session

1.  Open the PureFocus application.
2.  (Optional) Go to the Settings screen (usually a gear icon) to adjust focus and break durations if the defaults are not suitable.
3.  Return to the main screen.
4.  Press the "Start Focus" button (or similar icon) to begin your writing session.
5.  The timer will start counting down.

### Writing

*   Once the session starts, begin typing in the provided text area.
*   Focus on your writing. The application will handle the rest.

### Ending a Focus Session

*   When the focus session timer ends, you will receive a notification.
*   The text you wrote will be automatically saved.
*   You can choose to start a break session, start a new focus session, or exit the application.

### Setting Focus and Break Durations

1.  Navigate to the Settings screen.
2.  Find the options for "Focus Duration" and "Break Duration".
3.  Enter your desired values (usually in minutes).
4.  Settings will be saved automatically.

## 4. Tips for Maximum Productivity

*   **Set Goals:** Before starting a focus session, know what you want to achieve.
*   **Eliminate External Distractions:** Find a quiet place and turn off notifications from other devices if possible.
*   **Utilize Breaks:** Use break time to truly rest. Stand up, stretch, or look away from the screen.
*   **Be Consistent:** Try to use the Pomodoro technique regularly to build a good work rhythm.

## 5. Troubleshooting

*   **Application not responding:** Try force-closing the application and reopening it.
*   **Notifications not appearing:** Ensure you have granted notification permissions for PureFocus in your Android system settings.
*   **Text not saved:** Although there is auto-save, ensure the focus session ends correctly. If you force-close the application mid-session, there is a small chance the latest data might not be saved.
*   **Timer not resuming after restart:** The app automatically saves timer state every 10 seconds and when paused. If the timer doesn't resume after restarting the app, ensure you restart within 1 hour of the last session (saved states expire after 1 hour for accuracy).
