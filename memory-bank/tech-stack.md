# PureFocus - Technology Stack

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 29, 2025  
**Project:** PureFocus - Minimalist Focus Writing App  
**Philosophy:** Maximum performance with minimal complexity

## Technology Selection Criteria

All technology choices are evaluated based on:
1. **Performance Impact:** Does it contribute to speed and responsiveness?
2. **Simplicity:** Does it reduce complexity and development overhead?
3. **Native Integration:** Does it leverage platform capabilities effectively?
4. **Footprint:** Does it minimize app size and resource usage?
5. **Maintainability:** Is it sustainable for long-term development?

## Core Technology Stack

### 1. Platform & Language

**Target Platform:** Android (MVP)  
**Rationale:** Focus on single platform for MVP to achieve maximum optimization and faster development cycle.

**Programming Language:** Kotlin  
**Rationale:**
- Native Android performance when compiled to ART bytecode
- Modern language features reduce boilerplate code
- Excellent interoperability with Android SDK
- Strong type safety reduces runtime errors
- Concise syntax improves development speed

**Alternative Considered:** Java  
**Rejection Reason:** Kotlin offers better performance characteristics and more concise code without sacrificing Android compatibility.

### 2. UI Framework

**UI Toolkit:** Jetpack Compose  
**Rationale:**
- Declarative UI paradigm reduces complexity
- Native performance when properly optimized
- Modern Android development standard
- Excellent integration with Android architecture components
- Enables fine-grained performance control
- Reduces UI-related boilerplate code

**Performance Considerations:**
- Strict adherence to Compose performance best practices
- Continuous recomposition monitoring
- Minimal state changes and smart recomposition
- Custom composables only when necessary

**Alternative Considered:** Traditional Android Views  
**Rejection Reason:** While potentially faster in some scenarios, Compose offers better development velocity and maintainability without significant performance penalty when optimized.

**Alternative Considered:** Flutter  
**Rejection Reason:** Additional runtime overhead and larger app size. Not truly native Android.

**Alternative Considered:** React Native  
**Rejection Reason:** JavaScript bridge overhead impacts performance. Not suitable for speed-critical application.

### 3. Architecture & State Management

**Architecture Pattern:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)  
**Components:**
- **ViewModel:** Android Architecture Component ViewModel
- **State Management:** StateFlow/SharedFlow for reactive state
- **State Hoisting:** Compose state hoisting patterns
- **Dependency Injection:** Manual DI (no framework for MVP)

**Rationale:**
- Proven Android architecture pattern
- Excellent lifecycle management
- Reactive state updates without overhead
- No additional framework dependencies

**Alternative Considered:** Hilt/Dagger  
**Rejection Reason:** Unnecessary complexity and build-time overhead for simple MVP architecture.

### 4. Data Storage

**Primary Storage:** SharedPreferences  
**Use Cases:**
- Single text draft storage
- User preferences (theme, timer settings)
- App state persistence

**Rationale:**
- Minimal overhead and fastest access
- Perfect for simple key-value storage needs
- No database setup or migration complexity
- Automatic backup by Android system

**Alternative Considered:** Room Database  
**Rejection Reason:** Overkill for single document storage. Adds unnecessary complexity and overhead.

**Alternative Considered:** DataStore  
**Rejection Reason:** While modern, SharedPreferences is sufficient for MVP needs and has lower overhead.

### 5. Asynchronous Operations

**Framework:** Kotlin Coroutines  
**Rationale:**
- Native Kotlin async support
- Excellent performance characteristics
- Structured concurrency prevents memory leaks
- Seamless integration with Compose and ViewModel

**Scope Management:**
- ViewModelScope for UI-related operations
- Careful scope management to prevent leaks
- Minimal background processing

### 6. Build System & Optimization

**Build System:** Gradle with Kotlin DSL  
**Optimization Tools:**
- **ProGuard/R8:** Mandatory for release builds
  - Code shrinking and obfuscation
  - Dead code elimination
  - Method inlining optimization
- **Baseline Profiles:** For startup and runtime optimization
- **Strict Mode:** Enabled during development for performance monitoring

**Build Configuration:**
- Aggressive optimization flags
- Minimal debug information in release
- Resource shrinking enabled
- Vector drawable optimization

### 7. Development Tools

**Primary IDE:** Android Studio  
**Rationale:**
- Official Android development environment
- Excellent Kotlin and Compose support
- Built-in performance profiling tools
- Layout inspector and debugging capabilities

**Secondary IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
**Use Cases:**
- Documentation and project management
- Git operations and file management
- AI coding assistant integration

**Version Control:** Git with GitHub  
**Rationale:**
- Industry standard version control
- Excellent branching and merging capabilities
- Integration with development workflow

### 8. Testing Framework

**Unit Testing:** JUnit 5 + Kotlin Test + Robolectric  
**Testing Philosophy:** Real Android components over mocking for better reliability  
**Key Dependencies:**
- `robolectric:4.11.1` - Android environment simulation
- `androidx.test:core:1.5.0` - Android testing utilities
- `kotlinx-coroutines-test:1.10.2` - Coroutines testing support

**Testing Approach:**
- Robolectric for Android Context and SharedPreferences testing
- Real component testing instead of mocking when possible
- TestScope for coroutine testing with proper time advancement
- Direct state verification over behavior verification

**UI Testing:** Compose Testing Framework  
**Performance Testing:**
- Android Studio Profiler
- Compose Recomposition Counter
- JankStats for frame timing
- Custom performance benchmarks

**Migration Notes:**
- Migrated from Mockito to Robolectric for better test reliability
- Eliminated mocking complexity in favor of real Android components
- All 21 unit tests passing with improved stability

### 9. Dependency Management

**Philosophy:** Minimal dependencies, maximum control

**Essential Dependencies Only:**
- Android Core KTX
- Jetpack Compose BOM
- Compose UI, Foundation, Material3
- Activity Compose
- ViewModel Compose
- Lifecycle Runtime Compose
- Kotlin Coroutines

**Explicitly Avoided:**
- Third-party UI component libraries
- Heavy animation libraries
- Networking libraries (not needed for MVP)
- Image loading libraries
- Analytics frameworks (for MVP)
- Crash reporting (for MVP)

### 10. Performance Monitoring

**Development Phase:**
- Android Studio Profiler (CPU, Memory, Network)
- Layout Inspector for UI performance
- Compose Recomposition tracking
- Custom timing measurements

**Release Monitoring:**
- Manual performance testing on various devices
- Battery usage monitoring
- App startup time measurement
- Memory leak detection

## Rejected Technologies

### C/C++ with NDK
**Reason:** While offering peak performance, the complexity and JNI overhead would not provide net benefits for this application type. The UI and core logic are better served by optimized Kotlin/Compose.

### Cross-Platform Frameworks
**Reason:** Flutter, React Native, Xamarin all introduce additional runtime overhead and larger app sizes. Native Android development provides better performance control.

### Heavy UI Frameworks
**Reason:** Material Design Components library, third-party UI libraries add unnecessary weight. Custom Compose components provide better performance control.

### Database Solutions
**Reason:** SQLite, Room, Realm are overkill for single document storage. SharedPreferences provides optimal performance for simple data needs.

## Performance Targets

**App Launch:** < 1 second cold start  
**UI Responsiveness:** 60fps (16ms frame time)  
**Memory Usage:** < 50MB during operation  
**APK Size:** < 10MB  
**Battery Impact:** Minimal background processing

## Future Technology Considerations

**Post-MVP Potential Additions:**
- Room Database (if multiple documents needed)
- DataStore (for complex preferences)
- WorkManager (for background tasks)
- Compose Animation (for subtle UI enhancements)
- Baseline Profiles optimization

**Criteria for Addition:**
- Must maintain performance targets
- Must provide clear user value
- Must not compromise simplicity
- Must be thoroughly performance tested
