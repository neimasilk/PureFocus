# Android SDK Not Found: Preventing Unit Test Execution

## Task Attempted

The goal was to run the debug unit tests for the Android project using the Gradle command:
`./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --stacktrace`

## Error Encountered

The build consistently failed with the following error message:

```
Could not determine the dependencies of task ':app:testDebugUnitTest'.
> SDK location not found. Define a valid SDK location with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable or by setting the sdk.dir path in your project's local properties file at '/app/local.properties'.
```

This error indicates that Gradle could not find the Android SDK, which is essential for compiling and running tests that depend on Android libraries and resources (commonly, Robolectric tests or other unit tests that interact with Android framework classes).

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken

Several steps were taken to try and resolve this issue within the sandbox environment:

1.  **Verified `JAVA_HOME`**: Ensured `JAVA_HOME` was correctly set to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64`. This had previously resolved issues with other Gradle tasks (like `./gradlew tasks`) that depended on a valid JDK.
2.  **Searched for Android SDK**:
    *   Checked several common installation paths for the Android SDK (e.g., `/opt/android/sdk`, `/usr/local/android/sdk`, `/android_sdk`, `/sdk`, `/usr/lib/android-sdk`) using `ls`. None of these paths existed.
    *   Used `find / -name "platform-tools" -type d 2>/dev/null` and `find / -name "platforms" -type d 2>/dev/null` to search for characteristic subdirectories of an Android SDK. These searches did not yield any relevant SDK locations.
3.  **Configured `local.properties`**: As suggested by the error message, a `local.properties` file was created in the project root (`/app/local.properties`) with the following content:
    ```properties
    sdk.dir=/opt/android/sdk
    ```
    This was an attempt to point Gradle to a conventional SDK path, in case it was present but not configured via an environment variable.
4.  **Re-ran Tests**: After each significant troubleshooting step (like setting `JAVA_HOME` or creating `local.properties`), the `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` command was re-executed.

## Conclusion for Sandbox Environment

Despite these efforts, the "SDK location not found" error persisted. This strongly indicates that the **Android SDK is not installed or available in the current sandbox environment.** Without the Android SDK, unit tests that rely on Android framework components (such as those typically run by `testDebugUnitTest`) cannot be executed.

## Resolution in a Local/Standard Environment

In a local development environment, this issue would typically be resolved by:

1.  **Installing the Android SDK**: Downloading and installing the Android SDK from the official Android developer website. This usually involves installing Android Studio, which includes an SDK Manager, or using the command-line SDK tools.
2.  **Setting `ANDROID_HOME`**: Defining the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to point to the root directory of the installed Android SDK.
    *   Example (Linux/macOS): `export ANDROID_HOME="/path/to/your/android/sdk"`
    *   Example (Windows): `set ANDROID_HOME=C:\path\to\your\android\sdk`
3.  **Alternatively, configuring `local.properties`**: Ensuring the `local.properties` file in the Android project root contains the correct path to the SDK:
    `sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk` (use backslashes `\` for Windows paths if necessary, e.g., `sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\YourUser\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk`)

Once the SDK is correctly installed and its location is known to Gradle (either via `ANDROID_HOME` or `local.properties`), the unit tests should be able to resolve Android dependencies and execute.
