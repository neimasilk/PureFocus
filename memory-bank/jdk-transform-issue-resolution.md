# Resolving JdkImageTransform and jlink.exe Errors in Gradle

## Original Error

When attempting to run Gradle tasks, the build failed with errors related to `JdkImageTransform` and the inability to find or execute `jlink.exe`. This typically indicates an issue with the Java Development Kit (JDK) configuration being used by Gradle, where it cannot locate or properly utilize the `jlink` tool, which is essential for creating custom Java runtime images.

## Successful Resolution Steps

The issue was resolved by ensuring that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable was set to a valid and appropriate JDK path for the build environment.

1.  **Initial Attempts:** An initial attempt to set `JAVA_HOME` to a Windows-style path (`C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr`) failed in the Linux-based sandbox environment because the path format was incorrect.
2.  **Identifying Available JDKs:** The command `ls /usr/lib/jvm` was used to list available JDK installations within the sandbox.
3.  **Setting `JAVA_HOME`:** Based on the output, `JAVA_HOME` was set to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64`.
    ```bash
    export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64"
    ```
4.  **Verification:** The Gradle command `./gradlew tasks --stacktrace --info --warning-mode all` was executed again.

## Outcome

After setting `JAVA_HOME` to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64`, the `./gradlew tasks` command completed successfully. The `JdkImageTransform` and `jlink.exe` errors were no longer present in the build output.

## Important Note

During the successful Gradle execution, numerous "Resource missing" errors were observed (e.g., `Resource missing. [HTTP GET: https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/... ]`). These errors are likely due to the sandbox environment having limited or no internet access to download dependencies from repositories like Google Maven or Maven Central. However, for the `tasks` command (which primarily lists available tasks rather than compiling the full application), these missing dependencies did not hinder Gradle's initialization or the successful completion of the command itself. The core `jlink.exe` issue was resolved by the correct `JAVA_HOME` setting.
