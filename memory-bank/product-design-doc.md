# PureFocus - Product Design Document (PDD)

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 29, 2025  
**Project:** PureFocus - Minimalist Focus Writing App  
**Based on:** Project Proposal v1.2

## 1. Product Vision

**Vision Statement:** To create the fastest, most responsive, and exceptionally simple mobile writing application that eliminates all distractions and cognitive overhead, enabling users to achieve deep focus and flow state in their writing tasks.

**Core Philosophy:** Speed and simplicity above all else. Every design decision must pass the test: "Does this make the app faster and simpler?"

## 3. Target Users

*   **Students:** Need focus while studying or doing assignments.
*   **Writers and Content Creators:** Seeking a distraction-free environment to write articles, blogs, or scripts.
*   **Programmers and Knowledge Workers:** Require high concentration for complex tasks.
*   **Anyone who wants to improve productivity** by reducing digital distractions when working with text.

### User Stories

*   **As a student,** I want to be able to set a focus timer so I can study without interruption for a certain period, and get a notification when the session ends so I can take a short break.
*   **As a writer,** I want a minimalist interface without many distracting buttons or menus, so I can fully concentrate on my writing.
*   **As a programmer,** I want this application to be lightweight and fast, and to be able to save my work automatically so I don't worry about losing progress if something happens.
*   **As a general user,** I want to be able to easily set focus and break durations according to my needs, and see simple statistics about how much focus time I have achieved.

- **Breathing Room:** Generous whitespace to reduce visual clutter

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Targets

- **App Launch Time:** < 1 second cold start
- **Text Input Latency:** < 16ms (60fps)
- **Memory Usage:** < 50MB during normal operation
- **APK Size:** < 10MB
- **Battery Impact:** Minimal background processing

### 5.2 Platform Requirements

- **Target Platform:** Android (MVP)
- **Minimum SDK:** Android 7.0 (API 24)
- **Target SDK:** Latest stable Android version
- **Architecture:** MVVM with Jetpack Compose
- **Language:** Kotlin

### 5.3 Quality Attributes

- **Reliability:** 99.9% crash-free sessions
- **Responsiveness:** Immediate UI feedback
- **Accessibility:** Support for screen readers and large text
- **Offline Capability:** Full functionality without internet

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**
    *   Application startup time: < 2 seconds.
    *   UI Responsiveness: User interactions should feel instant, with no visible lag.
    *   Memory Usage: Kept low, ideally below 100MB during active use.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   The application must be stable and not crash during focus sessions.
    *   The timer must be accurate and notifications must be delivered on time.
    *   Automatic saving must function reliably to prevent data loss.
*   **Usability:**
    *   The interface must be intuitive and easy to learn, even for non-technical users.
    *   Settings should be easily accessible and understandable.
*   **Security:**
    *   User data (written text) must be stored locally and securely. No data transmission to external servers without explicit user permission (for future features like cloud synchronization).
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   The code must be clean, well-structured, and easy to modify or extend in the future.
    *   Adequate code documentation.
*   **Portability:**
    *   Initially focused on the Android platform. Consideration for other platforms (iOS, Desktop) can be explored in the future.
