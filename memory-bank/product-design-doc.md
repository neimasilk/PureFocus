# PureFocus - Product Design Document (PDD)

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 29, 2025  
**Project:** PureFocus - Minimalist Focus Writing App  
**Based on:** Project Proposal v1.2

## 1. Product Vision

**Vision Statement:** To create the fastest, most responsive, and exceptionally simple mobile writing application that eliminates all distractions and cognitive overhead, enabling users to achieve deep focus and flow state in their writing tasks.

**Core Philosophy:** Speed and simplicity above all else. Every design decision must pass the test: "Does this make the app faster and simpler?"

## 3. Target Users

*   **Students:** Need focus while studying or doing assignments.
*   **Writers and Content Creators:** Seeking a distraction-free environment to write articles, blogs, or scripts.
*   **Programmers and Knowledge Workers:** Require high concentration for complex tasks.
*   **Anyone who wants to improve productivity** by reducing digital distractions when working with text.

### User Stories

*   **As a student,** I want to be able to set a focus timer so I can study without interruption for a certain period, and get a notification when the session ends so I can take a short break.
*   **As a writer,** I want a minimalist interface without many distracting buttons or menus, so I can fully concentrate on my writing.
*   **As a programmer,** I want this application to be lightweight and fast, and to be able to save my work automatically so I don't worry about losing progress if something happens.
*   **As a general user,** I want to be able to easily set focus and break durations according to my needs, and see simple statistics about how much focus time I have achieved.

## 3. Core Features (MVP - Implemented)
