# PureFocus - Status, Todo & Suggestions

**Document Version:** 1.3
**Date:** 1 Juni 2025
**Project:** PureFocus - Minimalist Focus Writing App
**Status:** Phase 1 In Progress

## Current Status

**Active Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Text Editor (UNBLOCKED)
**Current Task:** Text Editor Optimization
**Progress:** Phase 0 is 100% complete. Phase 1 is 25% complete with Text Editor Foundation implemented.

**Recently Completed Baby-Step:** Baby-Step 1.1: Text Editor Foundation
- ✅ All tasks for Phase 0 are complete.
- ✅ Application is running on the emulator.
- ✅ Full-screen text editor UI implemented (`FocusWriteScreen.kt`).
- ✅ ViewModel integration for text state (`MainViewModel.kt`).
- ✅ Auto-save functionality implemented with debouncing in `PreferencesManager.kt`.
- ✅ Performance optimization for text input implemented.
- ✅ All unit tests are passing.

**RESOLVED ISSUES:**
**Issue:** Unit tests fail in `MainViewModelTests.kt`, particularly `updateText updates uiState immediately`
**Resolution:** 
- Updated `mockito-kotlin` to `5.4.0`.
- Updated `kotlinx-coroutines-test` to `1.10.2`.
- Added `testDispatcher.scheduler.runCurrent()` in debounce tests.
- All tests now pass successfully.

**Next Task:** "Text Editor Optimization"
- Implement copy/paste functionality with improved UX.
- Optimize memory usage for large text documents.
- Add text selection and basic formatting options.
- Implement scroll position saving and restoration.

## Current Baby-Step: Text Editor Optimization

**Objective:** Enhance the text editor with improved UX features and optimize for large text documents.

**Tasks:**
1. Enhance `FocusWriteScreen.kt` with copy/paste improvements.
   - Add custom copy/paste menu with improved UX.
   - Implement text selection highlighting.
   - Add scroll position saving and restoration.

2. Optimize `MainViewModel.kt` for memory efficiency.
   - Implement chunking for large text documents.
   - Add progressive loading for better performance.
   - Optimize debounce logic for frequent updates.

3. Add text selection and formatting features.
   - Implement basic text selection UI.
   - Add simple formatting options (bold, italic).
   - Ensure formatting persists with text content.

4. Enhance scroll position management.
   - Save scroll position with text content.
   - Restore position on app restart.
   - Implement smooth scrolling animations.

**Success Criteria:**
- Text editor handles documents up to 100,000 characters without performance degradation.
- Copy/paste operations work smoothly with custom UI.
- Text selection is intuitive and responsive.
- Scroll position is maintained across app restarts.
- Memory usage stays below 50MB for large documents.
- All unit tests pass.

**Validation Method:**
- Run unit tests for ViewModel and text processing.
- Manual testing with large text documents.
- Use Android Studio Profiler to verify memory usage.
- Verify scroll position persistence across app restarts.

### Phase 1: Core Text Editor (25% Complete)
- ✅ **Baby-Step 1.1: Text Editor Foundation** (Completed June 1, 2025)
- ⏳ **Baby-Step 1.2: Text Editor Optimization** (Current) (Copy, Large Text Handling)

## Baby-Step To-Do List Suggestion

### Next Baby-Step: "Text Editor Optimization"

**Objective:** Enhance the text editor with improved memory management, copy/paste functionality, and text selection features while maintaining high performance.

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days

**Detailed Tasks:**
1.  **Copy/Paste Enhancement (`FocusWriteScreen.kt`)**
    *   Implement custom copy/paste UI elements for better user experience.
    *   Add visual feedback for text selection.
    *   Ensure clipboard operations work efficiently with large text.
2.  **Memory Optimization (`MainViewModel.kt`)**
    *   Implement efficient text handling for large documents.
    *   Consider chunking or lazy loading for very large text.
    *   Add memory usage monitoring and optimization.
3.  **Text Selection and Basic Formatting**
    *   Implement text selection UI with handles.
    *   Add basic formatting options (bold, italic) if appropriate for the minimalist design.
    *   Ensure selection state persists appropriately.
4.  **Scroll Position Management**
    *   Save and restore scroll position when app is backgrounded/resumed.
    *   Implement smooth scrolling and maintain position during text changes.
    *   Add scroll position to saved state.

**Success Criteria:**
-   Copy/paste operations work smoothly with visual feedback.
-   Memory usage remains stable (< 50MB) even with large text documents (10,000+ characters).
-   Text selection is intuitive and responsive.
-   Scroll position is maintained when app is backgrounded and resumed.
-   All operations maintain the app's performance target (< 16ms per frame).

**Validation Methods:**
-   Test with large text documents to verify memory efficiency.
-   Measure and compare memory usage before and after optimizations.
-   Test copy/paste with various text sizes and content types.
-   Verify scroll position restoration after app restart.
-   Use Android Studio Profiler to monitor performance during all operations.

## Suggestions and Considerations

### Performance Optimization Reminders
-   Prioritize `remember` and `derivedStateOf` to minimize recompositions.
-   Profile frequently, especially the text input path.
-   Test on a physical device if possible, including lower-end models.

### Development Best Practices
-   Create new files in appropriate package structures (e.g., `ui/screen/`, `data/`).
-   Write unit tests for ViewModel logic, especially auto-save.

**Next Update:** After "Text Editor Optimization" baby-step completion.
**Review Frequency:** After each baby-step completion.
