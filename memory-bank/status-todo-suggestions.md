## High-Priority To-Do List

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1 Start)
1.  **Baby-Step: "Text Editor Foundation"** (Current Focus)
    *   Implement full-screen text editor UI using Jetpack Compose.
    *   Handle text input, keyboard management, and basic styling.
    *   Implement auto-save functionality to SharedPreferences.
    *   Optimize for performance (input latency, recompositions).

### Medium-Term Goals (Next 2-3 Weeks - Phase 1 & 2)
1.  **Core Text Editor Development (Phase 1)**
    *   Complete "Text Editor Foundation" baby-step.
    *   Implement text editor optimization (copy, memory usage for large text).
2.  **Pomodoro Timer Integration (Phase 2)**
    *   Basic timer implementation (ViewModel, coroutines).
    *   Timer UI and notifications (minimal, non-intrusive).

## Baby-Step To-Do List Suggestion

### Next Baby-Step: "Text Editor Foundation"

**Objective:** Implement the core text editor functionality with full-screen editing and auto-save capabilities, ensuring high performance.

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days

**Detailed Tasks:**
1.  **Text Editor UI Implementation (`FocusWriteScreen.kt`)**
    *   Create a new Composable function `FocusWriteScreen` in a new file `app/src/main/java/com/neimasilk/purefocus/ui/screen/FocusWriteScreen.kt`.
    *   This screen should contain a full-screen `BasicTextField` for text input.
    *   Ensure the text field takes up the entire screen, edge-to-edge.
    *   Implement basic keyboard handling (show/hide, focus management).
    *   Apply basic text styling (font size, color) from the existing theme.
2.  **ViewModel Integration (`MainViewModel.kt`)**
    *   Add a `MutableStateFlow<String>` to `MainViewModel.kt` to hold the editor's text content.
    *   Connect `FocusWriteScreen` to this StateFlow to display and update the text.
3.  **Auto-Save Functionality (`MainViewModel.kt` & `PreferencesManager.kt`)**
    *   In `MainViewModel.kt`, observe changes to the text StateFlow.
    *   Implement a debounced auto-save mechanism (e.g., save 1-2 seconds after the user stops typing).
    *   Use `PreferencesManager.kt` (create if it doesn't exist, or update if it does) to save the text to SharedPreferences under a key like `KEY_EDITOR_DRAFT`.
    *   Load the saved draft from SharedPreferences when the ViewModel is initialized.
4.  **Performance Optimization & Testing**
    *   Focus on minimizing recompositions in `FocusWriteScreen` during text input.
    *   Manually test typing responsiveness. Aim for <16ms input latency.
    *   Test auto-save and text restoration after app restart.

**Success Criteria:**
-   `FocusWriteScreen.kt` displays a full-screen text editor.
-   Text input is smooth and responsive (feels like 60fps).
-   Text is automatically saved to SharedPreferences a few seconds after typing stops.
-   The last saved text is restored when the app restarts.
-   Memory usage remains stable and low (< 50MB) during typing.

**Validation Methods:**
-   Run the app and verify the full-screen editor.
-   Type extensively and observe UI responsiveness.
-   Check SharedPreferences (e.g., via Device File Explorer) to confirm text is saved.
-   Restart the app (close and reopen) to verify text restoration.
-   Use Android Studio Profiler to monitor recompositions and memory usage.

## Suggestions and Considerations

### Performance Optimization Reminders
-   Prioritize `remember` and `derivedStateOf` to minimize recompositions.
-   Profile frequently, especially the text input path.
-   Test on a physical device if possible, including lower-end models.

### Development Best Practices
-   Create new files in appropriate package structures (e.g., `ui/screen/`, `data/`).
-   Write unit tests for ViewModel logic, especially auto-save.
