# PureFocus Project Status, To-Do List, and Suggestions

This document aims to provide an overview of the current status of the PureFocus project, a list of planned future work, and suggestions for the next small steps (baby steps).

## I. Current Status (As of January 2025)

* **Core Features Implemented:**
    * Pomodoro Timer (focus sessions, short breaks, long breaks) with duration customization.
    * Pomodoro functionality runs as a Foreground Service (`PomodoroService.kt`) to maintain reliability.
    * **‚úÖ State Persistence:** Timer state is now automatically saved and restored after app restarts.
    * **‚úÖ Notification Permissions:** Runtime notification permission request implemented for Android 13+.
    * "Focus Write" mode for distraction-free writing.
    * Settings Screen (`SettingsScreen.kt`) for user preference customization, saved using DataStore Preferences (`PreferencesManager.kt`).
    * Notifications for Pomodoro cycles (`NotificationHelper.kt`).
* **Code Quality & Architecture:**
    * The application is built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for the UI.
    * Follows the MVVM (ViewModel for UI logic) architectural pattern.
    * Dependency Injection is implemented using Hilt.
    * Asynchronous operations are handled with Coroutines and Flow.
    * **‚úÖ Code Cleanup:** Minor TODOs resolved, improved test coverage.
* **Testing:**
    * Unit tests for business logic (ViewModels, Services, DataManager) have been created.
    * UI tests (Espresso/Compose Test Rule) for the main screens (Pomodoro, Focus Write) have been created.
    * **‚úÖ Enhanced Testing:** Additional test cases for pause/resume and reset functionality.
    * Based on the latest information, **all existing unit tests have passed**.
* **General Conclusion:** The application's foundation is solid and production-ready. Core MVP features have been established with robust state management and proper Android 13+ compatibility. The project is ready for internal testing and moving towards MVP completion.

## II. Future Work List (Potential Roadmap)

Here is a list of tasks and features that can be considered for future development, both for refining the MVP and for subsequent releases. Priorities can be adjusted based on feedback and product strategy.

### A. Critical Enhancements & Quality (High Priority for MVP)

1.  **Implement Runtime Notification Permission Request (Android 13+):**
    * **Description:** Ensure the application explicitly requests the `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission from users on Android 13 (API 33) and above. Without this, notifications will not appear.
    * **Difficulty:** Low - Medium.
2.  **Review and Ensure `PomodoroService` State Persistence:**
    * **Description:** Ensure the timer's state (remaining time, current session, cycle count) can be precisely restored if the `PomodoroService` is stopped by the system and then restarted. Losing timer progress can degrade the user experience.
    * **Difficulty:** Medium.
3.  **User Statistics and Progress Tracking (If part of core MVP):**
    * **Description:** Implement a feature to track and display Pomodoro usage statistics (e.g., total focus time, number of sessions completed per day/week). This is a commonly expected feature in productivity apps.
    * **Components:** Data storage (possibly Room DB), aggregation logic, UI to display statistics.
    * **Difficulty:** Medium.

### B. Additional Features (Potential for Next Release or if MVP allows)

1.  **Blocking Distracting Apps:**
    * **Description:** Provide users with the ability to select apps –æ–Ω–∏ consider distracting and block access to them during focus sessions.
    * **Components:** App selection UI, blocking mechanism (e.g., using Accessibility Service or UsageStatsManager), complex permission handling.
    * **Difficulty:** High (requires handling sensitive permissions and potential Play Store policy challenges).
2.  **Basic Error Logging & Analytics Integration:**
    * **Description:** Add Firebase Crashlytics for automatic error reporting and Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with application features.
    * **Difficulty:** Low - Medium.
3.  **Custom Notification Sounds & Ambient Sounds Option:**
    * **Description:** Allow users to choose different notification sounds or enable calming background sounds during focus sessions.
    * **Difficulty:** Medium.
4.  **Cross-Device Data Sync (If relevant in the future):**
    * **Description:** Store user preferences and statistics in the cloud to enable synchronization across devices.
    * **Difficulty:** High.

### C. Polishing and Release Preparation

1.  **User Testing:** Conduct testing sessions with target users to get direct feedback on usability and functionality.
2.  **Advanced UI/UX Polishing:** Refine the appearance and user flow based on feedback and design standards.
3.  **Compatibility Testing:** Test the application on various devices, screen sizes, and Android versions.
4.  **Finalize Visual Assets and Texts:** Ensure all icons, images, strings, and documentation (User Guide, Changelog) are final.
5.  **Draft Privacy Policy:** Create and provide a clear privacy policy.

## III. "Baby-Step Todolist" Suggestions (Next Concrete Short-Term Steps)

        * [x] ‚úÖ Implemented user-friendly permission explanation
        * [x] ‚úÖ Tested on Android 13+ compatibility
