## High-Priority To-Do List

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 0 Completion)
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Set up Android Studio with latest stable version
   - Configure Kotlin and Jetpack Compose dependencies
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Initialize basic project structure
   - Verify development tools functionality

2. **Architecture Foundation**
   - Implement basic MVVM architecture
   - Set up theme system (light/dark)
   - Configure SharedPreferences wrapper
   - Set up performance monitoring utilities

3. **Phase 1 Preparation**
   - Clarify implementation plan with AI assistant
   - Create first baby-step for text editor implementation
   - Set up testing framework

### Medium-Term Goals (Next 2-3 Weeks)
1. **Core Text Editor Development**
   - Full-screen text input implementation
   - Auto-save mechanism
   - Performance optimization
   - Copy functionality

2. **Pomodoro Timer Integration**
   - Basic timer functionality
   - Non-intrusive UI integration
   - Notification system

3. **Essential Settings**
   - Minimal settings interface
   - Timer customization
   - Optional word count

## Baby-Step To-Do List Suggestion

### Next Baby-Step: "Project Foundation Setup"

**Objective:** Establish development environment and basic project structure with performance monitoring capabilities.

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days

**Detailed Tasks:**
1. **Repository Creation**
   - Create GitHub repository "PureFocus"
   - Initialize with README based on proposal
   - Set up proper Git workflow and commit conventions

2. **Android Studio Setup**
   - Install/update Android Studio to latest stable
   - Create new Android project with Compose
   - Configure Kotlin and Compose dependencies
   - Set up build.gradle with optimization flags

3. **Basic Architecture Implementation**
   - Create MVVM folder structure
   - Implement basic ViewModel with StateFlow
   - Set up theme system with light/dark modes
   - Create SharedPreferences wrapper class

4. **Performance Foundation**
   - Configure ProGuard/R8 for release builds
   - Set up performance monitoring utilities
   - Implement basic logging system
   - Configure Strict Mode for development

**Success Criteria:**
- Project builds successfully in Android Studio
- Basic "Hello World" Compose app runs on device/emulator
- Theme switching works and persists
- Release build is significantly smaller than debug
- Performance monitoring tools are functional

**Validation Methods:**
- Successful build and run on physical device
- Theme persistence across app restarts
- APK size comparison between debug and release
- Performance profiler accessibility and basic metrics

## Suggestions and Considerations

### Performance Optimization Reminders
- Continuously monitor app startup time during development
- Profile memory usage after each major feature addition
- Test on lower-end devices to ensure broad compatibility
- Measure and optimize Compose recomposition frequency

### Development Best Practices
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages
- Test each baby-step thoroughly before proceeding
- Update architecture.md with significant structural changes
- Maintain performance targets throughout development

### Risk Mitigation
- Keep backup of working versions before major changes
- Test on multiple Android versions and devices
- Monitor for memory leaks during extended usage
- Validate auto-save functionality regularly

### Future Considerations
- Plan for accessibility features early in development
- Consider internationalization structure for future expansion
- Design with potential iOS port in mind (but don't compromise Android optimization)
- Keep user feedback collection strategy in mind for post-MVP
