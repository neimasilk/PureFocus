    * [x] `FocusWriteViewModel` created with StateFlow for text management.
    * [x] Two-way data binding between UI and ViewModel implemented.
    * [x] Basic unit tests for `FocusWriteViewModel` added and passing.
    * [x] UI integration tests for `FocusWriteScreen` with ViewModel added.
* **UI/UX (Base Functional):**
    * [x] Basic UI is in place, functional yet minimalist.
    * [ ] Advanced visual enhancements are planned for later stages.

**Status Summary:** The application's Pomodoro features are complete and stable. With all tests passing, the project is ready to advance to the implementation of the `FocusWriteScreen`.

## Future To-Do List (High to Low Priority)

1.  **Full Implementation of `FocusWriteScreen`:**
    * [ ] Design UI/UX for distraction-free writing mode.
    * [ ] Implement text input area.
    * [ ] Option to hide UI controls while writing.
    * [ ] (Optional) Feature to "hide already typed text".
    * [ ] Integration with Pomodoro timer (e.g., automatically start a focus session when writing begins, or discrete timer controls).
    * [ ] Text saving strategy (decision needed: local SharedPreferences for single draft, or other methods if scope expands).
    * [ ] Comprehensive unit and UI tests for `FocusWriteScreen`.
2.  **Pomodoro Timer UI/UX Enhancements:**
    * [ ] Smoother transition animations for timer state changes.
    * [ ] More engaging timer visualization.
    * [ ] Notification sound customization.
    * [ ] Review user interaction flow for timer controls.
3.  **Themes and Visual Customization:**
    * [ ] Offer multiple theme choices.
    * [ ] Consider "Dynamic Color" (Material You) for Android 12+.
4.  **Notification Enhancements:**
    * [ ] Option for "sticky" notifications.
    * [ ] Quick actions on notifications.
5.  **Refinement and Optimization:**
    * [ ] Review battery usage.
    * [ ] UI performance optimization.
    * [ ] Further edge case handling.
6.  **Documentation:**
    * [ ] Complete KDocs for all public APIs and complex logic.
    * [ ] Update `USER_GUIDE.md` after new features are added.
    * [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` periodically.
7.  **Additional Features (Post-MVP):**
    * [ ] Basic Pomodoro session statistics.
    * [ ] Simple to-do list integrated with Pomodoro sessions.

## Suggested "Baby-Step Todolist" (Next Small Steps for FocusWriteScreen)

This todolist focuses on incrementally building the `FocusWriteScreen`. **Crucial Reminder: Do NOT proceed to the next baby step until all tests for the current step are passing.**

1.  **[FocusWriteScreen] Define Core MVP Requirements & Basic UI Structure:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   [x] **Task:** Clearly define the absolute minimum functionality for the *first* iteration of `FocusWriteScreen`. For example: a full-screen text input area, no permanent storage initially (text might be transient or saved to ViewModel state only for this baby step).
    *   [x] **Task:** Decide on the initial interaction with the Pomodoro timer. Will the timer be controllable from this screen, or does writing automatically imply a focus session? For this baby step, perhaps no direct timer interaction, just focus on text input.
    *   [x] **Task:** Implement the basic static layout of `FocusWriteScreen` using Jetpack Compose: a `TextField` that occupies most of the screen.
    *   [x] **Acceptance:** A screen with a large `TextField` is visible. No crashes.
2.  **[FocusWriteScreen] Implement Basic Text Input & ViewModel:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   [x] **Task:** Create `FocusWriteViewModel` to hold the text content as a `StateFlow<String>` or `StateFlow<TextFieldValue>`.
    *   [x] **Task:** Connect the `TextField` in `FocusWriteScreen` to this ViewModel, allowing two-way data binding (user types, ViewModel updates; ViewModel changes, `TextField` updates).
    *   [x] **Acceptance:** Text typed into the `TextField` is reflected in the ViewModel's state. If the ViewModel's state is changed programmatically, the `TextField` updates.
    *   [x] **Testing:** Add basic unit tests for `FocusWriteViewModel` to verify state updates.
3.  **[FocusWriteScreen] Add Basic UI Test for Text Input:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   [x] **Task:** Create a simple UI test for `FocusWriteScreen` that verifies:
        *   The `TextField` is displayed.
        *   Text can be typed into the `TextField`.
        *   The typed text is correctly displayed.
    *   [x] **Acceptance:** UI test passes.
4.  **[FocusWriteScreen] Minimalist Controls (Optional for this iteration, decide based on MVP definition from step 1):** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   [x] **Task:** Clear Text and Copy Text functionality already implemented in existing FocusWriteScreen.
    *   [x] **Acceptance:** Context menu with clear and copy functionality is available.
5.  **[Documentation & Review] Code Review and Documentation Update:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    *   [x] **Task:** Review the newly written code for `FocusWriteScreen` and `FocusWriteViewModel` for clarity, simplicity, and adherence to project conventions.
    *   [x] **Task:** Add KDoc comments to new public functions and classes.
    *   [x] **Task:** Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the features implemented in this baby step.
    *   [x] **Task:** Update `progress.md` to reflect completion of this baby step.
    *   [x] **Crucial:** Ensure all existing and newly added tests (unit and UI) are passing.
