# PureFocus - Status & Todo Suggestions

*Terakhir diperbarui: Desember 2024*

## Current Status

### ✅ COMPLETED - Core Features
*   Core text editing functionality with auto-save and manual save (via ViewModel) is implemented.
*   **✅ COMPLETED:** Manual Save and Clear Text UI controls are now exposed in `FocusWriteScreen` via context menu with confirmation dialog for clear action.
*   Pomodoro timer with work, short break, and long break sessions is functional as a foreground service.
*   **✅ COMPLETED:** Customizable short and long break durations are now available in Settings screen with proper validation and persistence.
*   **✅ COMPLETED:** Pomodoro controls (Start/Pause/Reset/Skip) are prominently displayed in bottom bar with real-time timer state display.
*   Basic settings for theme (dark/light mode), focus duration, short/long break durations, and sound notifications are available and persistent.
*   Notification system for Pomodoro session ends (focus and break) is in place.
*   Application requests notification permissions on newer Android versions.
*   Comprehensive UI structure with `MainActivity` hosting `FocusWriteScreen`, `SettingsScreen`, and `PomodoroBottomBar`.
*   State management is handled by Jetpack ViewModels and Kotlin Flows.
*   Data persistence is managed by `PreferencesManager` using SharedPreferences.
*   **✅ COMPLETED:** All unit tests are passing successfully including Compose UI tests with Robolectric configuration.

### ✅ COMPLETED - Documentation & Code Quality (Desember 2024)
*   **✅ COMPLETED:** Comprehensive documentation update (README.md, USER_GUIDE.md, DEVELOPER_SETUP.md)
*   **✅ COMPLETED:** KDoc documentation for core classes (ViewModels, Services)
*   **✅ COMPLETED:** Lint issues resolved (2 errors → 0 errors, 64 warnings → 52 warnings)
*   **✅ COMPLETED:** Code quality improvements and best practices implementation
*   **✅ COMPLETED:** Successful deployment and testing on physical device
*   **✅ COMPLETED:** Production-ready stability and performance optimization

## Future Tasks (High-Level)

*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   More polished visual design and animations.
    *   Improved navigation between screens/features.
    *   Accessibility improvements (WCAG compliance).
*   **Pomodoro Advanced Features:**
    *   Customizable break durations (short/long) via settings.
    *   Option for auto-starting next Pomodoro/break session.
    *   Sound customization for notifications.
    *   Visual timer progress indication (e.g., circular progress bar).
*   **Text Editing Enhancements:**
    *   Markdown support (preview and editing).
    *   Export text to different formats (e.g., .txt, .md).
    *   Search and replace functionality within the text editor.
    *   Version history for notes (simple undo/redo or more advanced).
*   **Productivity & Insights:**
    *   Statistics and history for completed Pomodoro sessions and writing activity.
    *   Goal setting features (e.g., daily writing goals, Pomodoro goals).
*   **Technical Improvements:**
    *   More comprehensive unit, integration, and UI testing.
    *   Refactor `PomodoroService` to potentially avoid static state exposure for better testability and instance management if multiple timers were ever needed (though unlikely for this app type).
    *   Explore options for background data sync (e.g., for settings or future cloud features).
    *   Performance optimization for very large text inputs.
    *   Robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

## Baby-Step Todolist (Next 1-3 Small, Actionable Tasks)

*   **Task 1:** Add Visual Timer Progress Indicator
    *   **Why:** Users need visual feedback on timer progress beyond just the countdown text. A circular progress bar or linear progress indicator would enhance UX.
    *   **How:** Add a `CircularProgressIndicator` or `LinearProgressIndicator` to `PomodoroBottomBar` that shows the percentage of current session completed. Calculate progress from `timeLeftInMillis` and session duration from `PreferencesManager`.
*   **Task 2:** Implement Auto-Start Next Session Option
    *   **Why:** Some users prefer continuous flow without manual intervention between sessions.
    *   **How:** Add a toggle setting in `SettingsScreen` for "Auto-start next session". When enabled, `PomodoroService` should automatically start the next session (break after focus, focus after break) with a brief countdown notification.
*   **Task 3:** Add Session Statistics and History
    *   **Why:** Users want to track their productivity and see patterns in their focus sessions.
    *   **How:** Create a simple statistics screen showing today's completed sessions, total focus time, and basic weekly/monthly summaries. Store session completion data in `PreferencesManager` or consider Room database for more complex queries.
