- üîÑ Basic architecture implementation in progress

## High-Priority To-Do List

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 0 Completion)
1. **Architecture Foundation Completion**
   - Implement full MVVM architecture structure
   - Create SharedPreferences wrapper class
   - Implement ViewModel with StateFlow
   - Add theme persistence functionality

2. **Performance Foundation**
   - Configure ProGuard for release builds (enable minify and shrinkResources)
   - Create performance monitoring utilities
   - Implement StrictMode for debug builds
   - Create Application class and register in AndroidManifest

3. **Phase 1 Preparation**
   - Write unit tests for initial components
   - Validate performance metrics (startup time, memory usage)
   - Create first baby-step for text editor implementation
   - Set up testing framework

### Medium-Term Goals (Next 2-3 Weeks)
1. **Core Text Editor Development**
   - Full-screen text input implementation
   - Auto-save mechanism
   - Performance optimization
   - Copy functionality

2. **Pomodoro Timer Integration**
   - Basic timer functionality
   - Non-intrusive UI integration
   - Notification system

3. **Essential Settings**
   - Minimal settings interface
   - Timer customization
   - Optional word count

## Baby-Step To-Do List Suggestion

### Next Baby-Step: "Text Editor Foundation"

**Objective:** Implement the core text editor functionality with full-screen editing and auto-save capabilities.

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days

**Detailed Tasks:**
1. **Text Editor UI Implementation**
   - Create full-screen text input component with Compose
   - Implement soft keyboard handling
   - Configure edge-to-edge display
   - Optimize for minimal UI elements

2. **Auto-Save Functionality**
   - Implement text change listener
   - Create auto-save mechanism with SharedPreferences
   - Add debounce functionality to prevent excessive writes
   - Implement state restoration on app restart

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize Compose recomposition for text input
   - Measure and optimize input latency
   - Implement efficient text rendering
   - Add performance monitoring for text operations

4. **Basic Text Operations**
   - Implement copy/paste functionality
   - Add basic text selection
   - Implement scroll behavior for long text
   - Handle text buffer efficiently

**Success Criteria:**
- Text editor launches in under 1 second
- Input latency less than 16ms (60fps typing experience)
- Text auto-saves reliably after changes
- Text state persists across app restarts
- Memory usage remains under 50MB during extended typing

**Validation Methods:**
- Measure startup time with performance monitoring
- Test typing experience on various devices
- Verify text persistence after force-closing app
- Monitor memory usage during extended typing sessions
- Validate smooth scrolling with large text documents

## Suggestions and Considerations

### Performance Optimization Reminders
- Continuously monitor app startup time during development
- Profile memory usage after each major feature addition
- Test on lower-end devices to ensure broad compatibility
- Measure and optimize Compose recomposition frequency

### Development Best Practices
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages
- Test each baby-step thoroughly before proceeding
- Update architecture.md with significant structural changes
- Maintain performance targets throughout development

### Risk Mitigation
- Keep backup of working versions before major changes
- Test on multiple Android versions and devices
- Monitor for memory leaks during extended usage
- Validate auto-save functionality regularly

### Future Considerations
- Plan for accessibility features early in development
- Consider internationalization structure for future expansion
- Design with potential iOS port in mind (but don't compromise Android optimization)
- Keep user feedback collection strategy in mind for post-MVP
