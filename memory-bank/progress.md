## Lessons Learned

### Documentation Phase Insights (Reconfirmed)
- Comprehensive upfront planning significantly clarifies development path.
- Performance targets must be defined early and tracked continuously.
- Memory bank approach provides excellent context for AI-assisted development.

### Foundation Setup Phase (Phase 0) Insights
- Enabling `buildConfig` is straightforward and essential for debug flags.
- Basic MVVM setup with `PureFocusApplication` and `MainActivity` updates provides a clean starting point.
- Getting the app to run on an emulator early, even with minimal UI, is a good validation of the core setup.
- Iterative refinement of build files and manifest is normal.

### Development Best Practices Established
- Performance-first approach in all architectural decisions.
- Minimal complexity and maximum simplicity as guiding principles.
- Continuous testing and validation at each step (even basic runs).
- Clear documentation of all architectural changes.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Current Risks (Moving into Phase 1)
- **Text Editor Performance:** Ensuring smooth typing and low latency in Compose `TextField` can be tricky. Mitigation: Continuous profiling, focus on recomposition optimization, testing on actual devices if possible.
- **Auto-Save Logic:** Implementing robust and efficient auto-save without performance degradation. Mitigation: Debouncing, background threading for SharedPreferences writes if necessary (though likely not for simple string saves).

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Regular performance benchmarking.
- Incremental development with thorough testing.
- Strict adherence to defined scope and success criteria.

## Team Productivity Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Phase 0 Duration:** 2 days (Documentation: 1 day, Foundation Setup: 1 day).
- **Average Baby-Step Duration:** Target 1-3 days for Phase 1 onwards.

### Quality Metrics
- **Documentation Completeness:** 100% for Phase 0.
- **Architecture Clarity:** High (comprehensive documentation, simple initial structure).
- **Phase 0 Success:** Application running on emulator.
