**RESOLVED ISSUES:**
**Issue:** Unit test reliability and mocking complexity in `MainViewModelTests.kt` and `PreferencesManagerTests.kt`
**Final Resolution (Migration to Robolectric):** 
- Migrated from Mockito mocking to Robolectric with real Android Context.
- Updated dependencies: Added `robolectric:4.11.1` and `androidx.test:core:1.5.0`.
- Removed all Mockito dependencies from test scope.
- Updated `PreferencesManagerTests` to use real SharedPreferences via `ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext<Context>()`.
- Updated `MainViewModelTests` to use real `PreferencesManager` instance instead of mocks.
- Fixed coroutine execution with `testScope.testScheduler.advanceUntilIdle()`.
- All 21 tests now pass with improved reliability using real Android components.

**Issue:** Need to maintain cursor position when editing text
**Resolution:**
- Replaced String with TextFieldValue in MainViewModel
- Updated FocusWriteScreen to support both String and TextFieldValue
- Added context menu for text copying
- Added visual feedback via Toast when text is copied

#### Baby-Step 2.1-2.7: Focus Write Mode Integration (COMPLETED)
**Completion Date:** May 30, 2025
**Duration:** 1 day
**Summary:** Implemented complete Focus Write Mode integration with Pomodoro Timer functionality.
**Key Outcomes:**
- Created `FocusWriteViewModel.kt` with Hilt dependency injection for text state management.
- Integrated `FocusWriteScreen.kt` with `FocusWriteViewModel` using `hiltViewModel()` and `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
- Implemented conditional display logic in `MainActivity.kt` - shows `FocusWriteScreen` during WORK sessions, `PomodoroTimerScreen` during breaks.
- Created `PomodoroTimerScreen.kt` for break session UI with timer controls.
- Added auto-save functionality with 2-second debouncing to prevent excessive saves.
- Configured Hilt dependency injection throughout the application (`@HiltAndroidApp`, `@AndroidEntryPoint`).
- Updated build configuration with proper Hilt dependencies and version catalog.
- Ensured text persistence using existing `PreferencesManager` integration.
- Maintained existing Pomodoro timer functionality while adding Focus Write Mode.
