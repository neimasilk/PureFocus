## Current Status

**Active Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Text Editor (UNBLOCKED)
**Current Status**

**Active Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Text Editor (UNBLOCKED)
**Current Task:** Pomodoro Timer Implementation (Preparing for Phase 2)
**Progress:** Phase 0 is 100% complete. Phase 1 is 50% complete with Text Editor Foundation and Optimization implemented.

**Recently Completed Baby-Steps:** 
- Baby-Step 1: Notifikasi Sederhana untuk Akhir Sesi Fokus (SELESAI ✅)
- Baby-Step 2: Input Durasi Sesi Fokus di UI Pengaturan Sederhana (SELESAI ✅)
- ✅ All tasks for Phase 0 are complete.
- ✅ Application is running on the emulator.
- ✅ Full-screen text editor UI implemented (`FocusWriteScreen.kt`).
- ✅ ViewModel integration for text state (`MainViewModel.kt`).
- ✅ Auto-save functionality implemented with debouncing in `PreferencesManager.kt`).
- ✅ Performance optimization for text input implemented.
- ✅ Copy text functionality implemented with context menu.
- ✅ TextFieldValue implementation for cursor position restoration.
- ✅ Text selection support added.
- ✅ Complete unit test migration from Mockito to Robolectric.
- ✅ All 21 unit tests passing with real Android components.

**RESOLVED ISSUES:**
**Issue:** Unit test reliability and mocking complexity in `MainViewModelTests.kt` and `PreferencesManagerTests.kt`
**Final Resolution (Migration to Robolectric):** 
- Migrated from Mockito mocking to Robolectric with real Android Context.
- Updated dependencies: Added `robolectric:4.11.1` and `androidx.test:core:1.5.0`.
- Removed all Mockito dependencies from test scope.
- Updated `PreferencesManagerTests` to use real SharedPreferences via `ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext<Context>()`.
- Updated `MainViewModelTests` to use real `PreferencesManager` instance instead of mocks.
- Fixed coroutine execution with `testScope.testScheduler.advanceUntilIdle()`.
- All 21 tests now pass with improved reliability using real Android components.

**Issue:** Need to maintain cursor position when editing text
**Resolution:**
- Replaced String with TextFieldValue in MainViewModel
- Updated FocusWriteScreen to support both String and TextFieldValue
- Added context menu for text copying
- Added visual feedback via Toast when text is copied

**Next Task:** "Baby-Step 2.1: Basic Timer Implementation"
- Create ViewModel for Pomodoro timer.
- Implement core logic for 25-minute work sessions and 5-minute short breaks.
- Ensure timer can run in the background (at least while the app is active).

## Lessons Learned

### Documentation Phase Insights (Reconfirmed)
- Comprehensive upfront planning significantly clarifies development path.
- Performance targets must be defined early and tracked continuously.
- Memory bank approach provides excellent context for AI-assisted development.

### Foundation Setup Phase (Phase 0) Insights
- Enabling `buildConfig` is straightforward and essential for debug flags.
- Basic MVVM setup with `PureFocusApplication` and `MainActivity` updates provides a clean starting point.
- Getting the app to run on an emulator early, even with minimal UI, is a good validation of the core setup.
- Iterative refinement of build files and manifest is normal.

### Development Best Practices Established
- Performance-first approach in all architectural decisions.
- Minimal complexity and maximum simplicity as guiding principles.
- Continuous testing and validation at each step (even basic runs).
- Clear documentation of all architectural changes.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Current Risks (Moving into Phase 1)
- **Text Editor Performance:** Ensuring smooth typing and low latency in Compose `TextField` can be tricky. Mitigation: Continuous profiling, focus on recomposition optimization, testing on actual devices if possible.
- **Auto-Save Logic:** Implementing robust and efficient auto-save without performance degradation. Mitigation: Debouncing, background threading for SharedPreferences writes if necessary (though likely not for simple string saves).

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Regular performance benchmarking.
- Incremental development with thorough testing.
- Strict adherence to defined scope and success criteria.

## Team Productivity Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Phase 0 Duration:** 2 days (Documentation: 1 day, Foundation Setup: 1 day).
- **Average Baby-Step Duration:** Target 1-3 days for Phase 1 onwards.

### Quality Metrics
- **Documentation Completeness:** 100% for Phase 0.
- **Architecture Clarity:** High (comprehensive documentation, simple initial structure).
- **Phase 0 Success:** Application running on emulator.
