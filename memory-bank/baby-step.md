**Note:** This file will be populated by the AI Planning Assistant (Gemini) with specific, detailed instructions for each development iteration. Each baby-step should be small enough to complete in 1-3 days and must have clear, testable success criteria.

**Usage Instructions:**
1. AI Planning Assistant fills this template with specific baby-step details
2. Developer reviews and clarifies any ambiguities
3. AI Coding Assistant (Jules) implements based on these instructions
4. Developer validates completion using the criteria provided
5. File is archived/deleted after successful completion

**Performance Reminder:** Every baby-step must maintain or improve app performance. No feature is worth compromising the core speed and responsiveness goals.
