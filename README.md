**"Speed and Simplicity Above All Else"** - PureFocus Development Philosophy

*Built with ❤️ for writers who value focus over features*

**🎯 Mission Accomplished: The Blazing-Fast Minimalist Focus App is COMPLETE!**

## Project Description

PureFocus is an Android productivity application fanatically engineered for **extreme speed, simplicity, and deep focus**. It's designed to help users concentrate on one essential writing task at a time by providing a hyper-minimalist, distraction-free environment. PureFocus aims to load instantly and respond without any perceptible lag, allowing users to immerse themselves in their work immediately.

The core philosophy is to be an **exceptionally lightweight and intuitively understandable tool** that actively supports single-tasking and deep work principles.

This project is developed following the "Vibe Coding Indonesia Guide V1.2.1" methodology.

## Core App Philosophy & Principles

* **Blazing Speed & Responsiveness (Absolute Priority):** Engineered for best-in-class startup time and a lag-free user experience.
* **Extreme Minimalism & Immediate Understandability:** The UI is self-explanatory, allowing users to understand its purpose and how to use it within seconds.
* **Single-Tasking (Focus Write Mode):** The MVP exclusively features a minimalist text editor integrated with a Pomodoro timer to enforce focus on one writing task.
* **Distraction-Free Environment:** No unnecessary elements, notifications (except for Pomodoro), or animations.
* **Featherlight Footprint:** Prioritizing minimal resource consumption and a small application size.

## Current Project Status
